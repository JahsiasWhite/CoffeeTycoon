# Coffee Tycoon 2005

This repository contains the game [Coffee Tycoon](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/coffee-tycoon-i2w) in an .iso format, created by combining the original .bin and .cue files into one ISO image for easier access.

## How to Play

1. Install
   - Click on the game or releases tab to download the .iso file
2. Mount the .ISO
   - Right-click the .iso file and select Mount (Windows 10/11 has built-in ISO mounting support).
3. Run the installer
4. Play the game!

## How to Handle BIN/CUE Files (Before Conversion to ISO)
Since this game comes in a .bin and .cue format, you'll need to follow one of these two methods to mount and play the game if you don't want to use the above .iso:

Option 1: Convert BIN/CUE to ISO
You can convert the .bin and .cue files into a single .iso file using software that supports ISO/BIN conversions. One such program is [bin2iso](https://gitlab.com/bunnylin/bin2iso), which allows you to easily convert files.

Option 2: Mount the BIN/CUE Directly
You can use a program like Daemon Tools to mount the .bin and .cue files directly without converting them into an .iso.
